This is just a reminder that the fonts selected for the logo should only be used in the logo and nowhere else. This will allow your logo to stand out throughout the brand usage without feeling overused and feeling like its just any other text on your page.

If you do download this font to use it on your website or anywhere else that isn't in the logo image, make sure to purchase the license for this font as you will need your own license to use on the web (which is different from using in the logo).

Do not use trial or "free for personal use" fonts as those fonts are for personal use only.

If you need any suggestions for fonts to use across your website and brand assets use Google fonts as they have no license limitations.

Thank you.
